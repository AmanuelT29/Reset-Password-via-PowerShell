# Reset User Passwords via PowerShell

## Platform and Tools Used

## Objective

In this small project, I will demonstrate how to reset a user password using Windows PowerShell. I will take on the role of an admin named Phillip and reset the password for a user named Sophie.

The process involves two main steps:

**1.** Creating a new (temporary) password.

**2.** Enforcing a password reset at the next logon, so that when Sophie logs in with the temporary password, she is required to create a new one before accessing her computer.
